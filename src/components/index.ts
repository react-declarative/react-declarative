/**
 * The TypeScript code is a bunch of export statements.
 *
 * This file behaves as a central hub for exporting values (like components, functions, or variables) from individual modules. Each `export * from './ModuleName';` statement takes all exports from a corresponding module file and re-exports them.
 *
 * Let's break down each line:
 *
 * `export * from './One';` - This line of code is exporting everything that the file `One.ts` (or `One.tsx`, `One.js`, `One.jsx` depending on your setup) exports, from its current location. The same goes for all the other lines as well.
 *
 * So if `./One` was exporting a function called `function1` like this:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * export function function1() {
 *     return "I'm function 1";
 * }
 * ```
 * Then, with this export in the main file, you will be able to import it elsewhere like:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { function1 } from './theMainFile';
 * ```
 *
 * This kind of structure is used to streamline imports in larger projects, where you want to import many things from one place rather than from individual files.
